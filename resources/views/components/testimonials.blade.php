Treatment in KSA was beyond of my reach since it is extremely expensive.while others less costly options were not preferable due to lack of experienced doctors and medical facilities, Later I found the website with cheap price for the same treatment in Kerala with top class doctors and state of the art Hospital. The unbelievable fact is the service from "KairHealth" is entirely free and I didnt have to pay for their service from My Arrival in India,the hospital pays them for their service. One of the staff from Kaiur Health was Always with me since they Picked from airport till the hospital made me comfortable in a fully fledged room soon after I reached the hospital. Thank you once again Team KairHealth for your unmatchable service that lasted till you guys took me to the Airport.</p>

Today, I am in excellent healthy condition and in good physique , Nevertheless, I must thank to the KairHealth medical travel company for making my trip to India and the treatment in the hospital so comfortable and convenient. I was suffering from sever kidney problems and this was causing damages to my family emotionally and financially. When we contacted the Kair Health website, everything fell in place for us as they sorted out all matters for us within few hours. They asked us to send the reports via email for opinion of top doctors. Then they told us about the surgery and its costs, which was affordable to us. The website people took our every care from arriving at the airport to the last day of our stay in India and the hospital.
